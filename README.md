## Usage

### Dataset

Please download the dataset from [ISIC](https://www.isic-archive.com/) challenge and [PH2](https://www.fc.up.pt/addi/ph2%20database.html) website.

### Pre-processing

Please run:

```bash
$ python src/process_resize.py
$ python src/process_point.py
```

You need to change the **File Path** to your own.

### Point Maps

For your convenience, we release the processed maps and the dataset division.

Please download them from [Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pNbH5zUI8Dw_ZAC8Iq9f7w) (codeï¼š**kmqr**) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mSLt-ipLM9CxrfvwgjJr5V9NKrpnQaQ5/view?usp=sharing)

The file names are equal to the original image names.

### Training 

### Testing

1. Download the pretrained weight for [PH2]()

Please run:
```bash
$ python test.py
```


## TODO

1. We will improve the network to give a more powerful and simple lesion segmentation framework.

2. The weights will be uploaded before next month.
