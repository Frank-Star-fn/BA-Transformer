## Results

## Usage

### Dataset

Please download the dataset from [ISIC](https://www.isic-archive.com/) challenge.

### Pre-processing

Please run:

```bash
$ python src/ISBI_resize.py
$ python src/point_gen.py
```

### Point Maps

For your convenience, we release the processed maps and the dataset division.

Please download them from [Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1pNbH5zUI8Dw_ZAC8Iq9f7w). Codeï¼škmqr.

The file names are equal to the original image names.

### Training and testing

## TODO

1. We will improve the network to give a more powerful and simple lesion segmentation framework.

2. The weights will be uploaded before next month.
