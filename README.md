# Boundary-aware Transformers for Skin Lesion Segmentation

Recently, transformers have been proposed as a promising tool for global context modeling by employing a powerful global attention mechanism, but one of
their main shortcomings when applied to segmentation tasks is that they cannot effectively extract sufficient local details to tackle ambiguous boundaries. We propose a novel boundary-aware transformer (BAT) to comprehensively address the challenges of automatic skin lesion segmentation.
